## Usage

This library exports a form viewer.

### Display a Form

Renders a form based on our [form schema](./docs/FORM_DEFINITION.md) and existing data:

```javascript
import { createForm } from '@bpmn-io/form-js';

const form = createForm({
  schema,
  data,
  container: document.querySelector('#form')
});

form.on('submit', (event) => {
  console.log(event.data, event.errors);
});
```

See [viewer documentation](./packages/form-js-viewer) for further details.
